      <description>In this game of poker, the rules are simple: the user will input the number of players into the code as an argument. The script will as the names of every player, then deal 5 cards each. In this version of the game, we just compare the hands, and the hand with the highest card wins. In the case of a tie where multiple players have the same highest card, it script will revert to each player&amp;rsquo;s second highest card to compare.</description>
